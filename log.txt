Better late than never to log notes.
Currently have written most logic for functions, as well as dividing project
into multiple files. I am now commencing testing on certian functions that
don't depend on too many others.

First is the getSentenceListFromFiles() function, I need to figure out how to
properly parse words and split them in half if they have a punctuation that
doesn't terminate a sentence. I created a function to bring a string to
lowercase since that is also required.

I'm noting that parsing the text can be quite long winded. It's probably less
of a hassle on Python, the intended language for this project. Perhaps consider 
including the text parsing as starter code.

This push successfully read the test-hows-it-going.txt file into a 2D vector,
dividing each sentence into a vector of strings.
